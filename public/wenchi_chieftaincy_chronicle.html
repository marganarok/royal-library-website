        <h1>The Wenchi Chieftaincy Dispute: A 70-Year Chronicle</h1>
        
        <div class="intro">
            The Wenchi chieftaincy dispute represents one of Ghana's most protracted traditional authority conflicts, spanning over seven decades and involving two primary royal families: the Sofoase Yefri Royal Family (to which former Prime Minister Dr. K.A. Busia belonged) and the Ahenfie Yefri Royal Family. This dispute has been characterized by multiple government interventions, court cases, committees of inquiry, and periods of political victimization that have significantly impacted the development of the Wenchi Traditional Area.
